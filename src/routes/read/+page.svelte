	<h2 class="mb-4">Hello Brandon and Chris (and Kristen and Joe)!</h2>
	<p>
		I put this app together for our interview. I typed this up in case we don't have time to talk
		about it. It's a trivial app, but I built it with the specific stack in the job description, and
		it demonstrates the very basics of a full-stack application. It collects data from a user and
		sends POST/PUT requests from the client to a backend API endpoint I created to interact with a
		database. It uses Svelte/SvelteKit, Tailwind, and MongoDB (Mongo Atlas). It is live on the
		internet, deployed with Vercel. I've included the GitHub repo above if you'd like to take a look
		(GitHub was also on the job description).
	</p>
	<p>
		I think it's very cool that Hyfin is using Svelte. What a fun framework! I like building React
		apps with Redux for global state management. I really enjoy Svelte's built-in way of handling
		global state compared to setting up and using Redux. I love Svelte's approach to reactivity in
		general! I'm a big fan of what Vercel is doing with NextJS and was excited to find out Svelte is
		the Vercel team.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm very excited about the possibility of working with you all at Hyfin. I love building things
		with code, and I'm very eager to learn from other developers and continue to grow my skills. I'm
		very easy to get along with, and I know how to work hard. This opportunity is very important to
		me, and I'd like to make sure you know that I REALLY want it. I will be an asset to the team and
		I will work hard to make you feel good about hiring me. I'm ready to jump in and start working!
